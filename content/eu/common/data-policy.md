| Registered Users | Unregistered Users | FTP Data | GDPR Compliance |
|------------------|--------------------|----------|-----------------|
| User data on UseGalaxy.eu (i.e. datasets, histories) will be available as long as they are not deleted by the user. Once marked as deleted, the datasets will be permanently removed after 14 days. If the user "purges" the dataset in Galaxy, it will be removed immediately, permanently. An [extended quota can be requested](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9w2MOS6KOlu9XdhRSDqWnCDkzoVBqHJ3zH_My4p8D8ZgkIQ/viewform){: target="_blank"} for a limited time period in special cases. | Processed data will only be accessible during one browser session, using a cookie to identify your data. This cookie is not used for any other purposes (e.g. tracking or analytics). If UseGalaxy.eu service is not accessed for 90 days, those datasets will be permanently deleted. | Any user data uploaded to our [FTP server](https://usegalaxy-eu.github.io/ftp/) should be imported into Galaxy as soon as possible. Data left in FTP folders for more than 3 months, will be deleted. | The Galaxy service complies with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). You can read more about this on our [Terms and Conditions](https://usegalaxy-eu.github.io/gdpr/). |
