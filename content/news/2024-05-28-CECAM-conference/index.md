The [EuroScienceGateway (ESG)](https://galaxyproject.org/projects/esg/) team, working in the UK to develop Galaxy tools for materials science gave a talk on Develop and engage: Sustainable software tools for large-scale facilities using the galaxy platform at the [CECAM Psi-k Research Conference](https://www.cecam.org/workshop-details/electronic-structure-simulations-for-large-scale-facilities-opportunities-challenges-and-roadmaps-1207#program-1207) for Electronic-structure simulations for large-scale facilities: Opportunities, challenges, and roadmaps.

This talk shows an example of how sustainable modelling software is developed at a national facility such as the [Science and Technology Facilities Council in the UK](https://www.ukri.org/councils/stfc/); and shows the potential of the Galaxy platform.

Abstract of the talk is available on the conference website.
