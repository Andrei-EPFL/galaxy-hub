Molecular Adaptation to Land: plant evolution to change ([MAdLand](https://madland.science/)) is a DFG-funded research consortium which explores the molecular mechanism behind the transition of plants and algae from water to land. Deepti Varshney and Dr. Saskia Hiltemann from the University of Freiburg gave a talk about the [MAdLand Resources and Tools](https://madland-meeting.de/assets/files/Abstract-Book_26_9_24_A4_V4.pdf) during the 2nd day of this meeting. In this workshop, they [presented](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10Kl4xrYIe6QfHrRhF1lqcWDF5v8_42fPa_Rs-skUUt8/edit#slide=id.g2b8b453cd39_0_164) the [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.eu/) as a free and open-source, web-based platform for conducting data-intensive life science research. The Galaxy Training Network (GTN) was introduced to the audience and its application to teach and do data analysis on real biological datasets were discussed. As an example, [the MAdLandDB (also known as the Genome Zoo)](https://github.com/Rensing-Lab/Genome-Zoo) was used to demonstrate the application of a high quality community curated protein sequence database of non-seed plants and streptophyte algae for sequence similarity search using tools such as BLAST and Diamond on the usegalaxy.eu as well as educational material available on [the GTN](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/ncbi-blast-against-the-madland/tutorial.html). Another tool that was introduced during this workshop was [TAPscan v4](https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/tapscan/tapscan_classify/4.76+galaxy0) which is available via the usegalaxy.eu portal as well for genome-wide annotation of plant transcription-associated proteins including both transcription factors and transcriptional regulators. In addition to this, the [DataPLANT Research Data Management](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/fair/tutorials/dataplant-arcs/tutorial.html) (RDM) platform which supports the generation of Annotated Research Contexts (ARC) was presented. ARCs are a RO-Crate implementation and provide an easy-to-use way to re-analyze data generated by the community in the Galaxy.  [DataPLANT](https://training.galaxyproject.org/videos/watch.html?v=fair/tutorials/dataplant-arcs/slides) ensures that all research data, including raw data and metadata, is encapsulated in a FAIR, open, and standardized format.
