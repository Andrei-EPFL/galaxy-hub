# The Galaxy Training Academy 2024 trained researchers in Galaxy data analysis world wide across a variety of scientific topics.


From October 7th to 11th, the [Galaxy Training Network (GTN)](https://training.galaxyproject.org/) hosted a global online Galaxy training course. This asynchronous, self-paced learning event was similar to last year’s GTN Smörgåsbord events, which have been successfully running since 2021.

We would like to thank everyone who participated in the event!


## The event 

The [Galaxy Training Academy](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/events/galaxy-academy-2024.html) kicked off on Monday with an introductory day, providing participants with an opportunity to familiarize themselves with the Galaxy data analysis platform or enhance their skill sets in specific areas, such as through the Data Manipulation Olympics.

Over the following days, eight different scientific tracks were offered, each featuring individualized learning paths. On Friday, participants could "choose their own adventure" from the entire collection of GTN training materials.

The [full program](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/events/galaxy-academy-2024.html#program) and detailed event [setup instrauction](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/events/galaxy-academy-2024.html#setup) were provided to participants in advance.

All learning materials for the event were linked from the program, including written guides as well as recorded sessions.


## Participants
With over 2,829 registered participants, the GTA provided training to a wide range of learners from around the world. The majority of participants had little to no experience with Galaxy, with 42.5% being new users and 41.9% identifying as beginners. Nearly all participants came from an academic background, with only 2.9% being industry professionals.

## Community and support

Before the event, an individualized learning path was created for each scientific track. All offered tutorials were tested to ensure they ran smoothly on all Galaxy instances participating in the event. Additionally, recordings were prepared for many of the tutorials.

The entire event was supported by the incredible GTN community, providing assistance 24/7 through the Slack chat platform. Each track had its own dedicated channel where instructors promptly offered help and advice.

In total, 80 people contributed to the event, working on 53 updated tutorials, producing 27 new recorded videos from 24 speakers, and providing extensive Slack support throughout the event.
