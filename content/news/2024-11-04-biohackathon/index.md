The this year [BioHackathon Europe](https://biohackathon-europe.org/index.html) in Barcelona took place between the 04.11 - 08.11. Some members from the Freiburg Galaxy Team went there and participated in various Galaxy-related project. The event was a total blast: 5 days in a remote area to work, code, have fun, eat and discuss with the 150 other participants from all Europe (even Australia)!

The main projects that interacted with Galaxy were: 

# [Project 20](https://github.com/elixir-europe/biohackathon-projects-2024/blob/main/11.md)

Building on the achievements of BioHackathon Europe 2023, we successfully enhanced the Galaxy ecosystem by extending the capabilities of the existing Galaxy tool list table. A major milestone was addition of workflows and training leading to the the creation and of the Galaxy Communities Dock (Galaxy Codex). 
This new resource also integrates the Galaxy Labs and allows to automatically add community resources. 

This project was led by Bérénice Batut and Wendi Bacon. Paul Zierep helped with updates to the CI and minor code improvements.  

The updates are available via the [Galaxy CoDex](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy_codex) GitHub repository.

# [Project 21](https://github.com/elixir-europe/biohackathon-projects-2024/blob/main/21.md)

This project worked on a vision of a “federated microbiome analysis service”. 
Paul Zierep participated in the discussion involving Galaxy and Alireza Heidari supported front-end related coding.

A preprint is available (Enhancing multi-omic analyses through a federated
microbiome analysis service)[http://preview.biohackrxiv.org/papers/154602ea-ae08-42c0-bb65-0b737d282207/paper.pdf]

# [Project 22](https://github.com/elixir-europe/biohackathon-projects-2024/blob/main/22.md)

Project Objectives
The objective of the project can be divided into two milestones:

* Development of a workflow that connects EGA, either central or any federated node, and Galaxy through Crypt4GH protocols.
* Galaxy's secure processing protocol: Sensitive datasets are kept encrypted throughout, with sensitive derivative results labelled as sensitive.

# [Project 26](https://github.com/elixir-europe/biohackathon-projects-2024/blob/main/26.md)



# Fun time

And we had an overall great time joining the sport events, wine tasting and amazing food !
