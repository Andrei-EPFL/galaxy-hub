# Welcome to iMAGE-NET – Image Analysis Network in Galaxy!

We are a diverse group of users, developers, trainers, and imaging data enthusiasts, all collaborating to expand Galaxy’s image analysis capabilities bringing the latest tools, feedback, and beyond.

## Who We Are:

- **Developers**: Are you building image analysis tools in Galaxy, or thinking of starting a project here? Do you need users, testers, or just want to make sure you’re not duplicating tools that already exist? Join us to connect, share ideas, and get support for your development journey!

- **Users**: Do you use Galaxy’s image analysis tools for bio-imaging, Earth observation, or other fields? Have feedback for us, or interested in testing new resources? Perhaps you have ideas or requests for new tools—your input can help shape future developments!

- **Trainers**: Are you using Galaxy to train others in image analysis? If you have suggestions or specific needs to better support your trainees, we’d love to hear from you. Your insights are invaluable in helping us create better learning experiences and share data image analysis knowledge. 

##  Connect with iMAGE-NET

If you’re interested in image analysis (within or outside Galaxy) and want to help ensure our tools represent the best, up-to-date practices, your feedback is needed! We’re constantly looking for ways to improve, whether in scientific fields already supported by Galaxy image analysis or in exploring new applications.

If you’re passionate about shaping the future of image analysis in Galaxy and want to help build a strong, collaborative, and supportive community, **you’re in the right place!**
