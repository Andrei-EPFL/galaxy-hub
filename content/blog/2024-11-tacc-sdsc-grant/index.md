The Galaxy teams at Penn State and Johns Hopkins Universities received an
award from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) through the
[https://commonfund.nih.gov/dataecosystem Common Fund Data Ecosystem] (CFDE) to
develop the CFDE Cloud Workspace Implementation Center (CWIC). The project was
awarded for five years under NIH Award #OT2OD037936.

We will collaborate with the [https://tacc.utexas.edu/ Texas Advanced Computing Center] (TACC)
and the [https://www.sdsc.edu/ San Diego Supercomputing Center] (SDSC) to
build a comprehensive cloud workspace to support the NIH research community.
By building on the Galaxy platform, the CloudBank project, and the powerful
computing and data storage of TACC, the CFDE Cloud Workspace will offer
researchers an intuitive starting point to manage and integrate datasets;
draw from a large, established catalog of bioinformatics tools; build, share,
and search for workflows that align with their datasets; and support
collaboration with trusted colleagues.
