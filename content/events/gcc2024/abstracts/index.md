# GCC2024 abstracts

Presentations from the community are a core component of GCCs. These include
oral, poster, and demo presentations. All the abstracts for presentations are
are submitted by the community and go through a peer review process by the
[scientific committee](/events/gcc2024/organizers/#scientific-committee-members)
before being accepted into the conference program. Once the conference program
has been finalized, an electronic version of the abstract book will be made
available.

GCC2024 is a Galaxy-centric conference but the topics presented can vary
greatly. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:
* Methods and pipelines for analysis of data that leverage Galaxy
* New or improved features within the Galaxy framework
* Outreach, training, and education in data science with Galaxy
* Tools and data integrated with Galaxy

**For GCC2024, all presentations must be in-person** so if you cannot attend the
conference in Brno, please do not submit an abstract. By submitting an abstract,
you agree that at least one of the authors will register and present the work.


# Call for Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions is open

Birds of a Feather, or BoF, sessions are informal gatherings during GCC that
allow participants to discus topics of interest. These are free-form events
that are organized by the participants and can take any form you'd like (eg,
presentations, brainstorming, architecture drawing, etc.).

**Interested in organizing a BoF? [Fill out this
form](https://forms.gle/bgbNpfc7YvLPz2ty7)** with some details so we can add it
to the schedule and help advertise. Also, keep an open mind and feel free to
propose fun activities as well, such as an evening run or a city tour.

# Logistical details for talks, posters, and demos


## Talk details

For GCC2024, **all talks will be 10 minutes long**. This includes time for
discussion with the audience so please plan your presentation accordingly. Every
accepted talk will automatically have an option to also present a poster.

Slides for your talk will be projected on a screen in the 16:9 format.

GCC2024 presentations will be streamed live. To support virtual attendees, **the
organizers will need slides for all talks by June 15.** We ask that you please
create your slides in [Google Slides](https://slides.google.com), share the
slide deck with *anyone with the link* (in view-only mode), and provide a link
in [this
spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-YnNkpP9jQ40SlFno-eemR33-KfjBn-W2vPkC5LhRCk/edit?usp=sharing)
by the June 15 deadline. Note that there is no prescribed template for the
slides, just the ask to use Google Slides to make and share your slides. Also
note that you are welcome to change your slides even after you've provided a
link to them, all the way until the morning of your presentation. You can see
when you will talk on the [schedule](/events/gcc2024/schedule/#talks) page.


## Poster details

**Posters should fit within a 96cm wide and 110cm heigh (37" x 44") space, or A0
paper format.**. Supplies for hanging posters are provided during the poster
sessions. You must bring a printed poster to the conference; there will be no
opportunity to print at the conference or for the organizers to print your
poster.

If you do not want to travel with a poster, here are a couple of companies in
Brno that will print posters. Check with them about the timelines by when they
have to have received your poster to print it in time.

* [Planotisk](https://www.planotisk.cz/)


## Demo details

Demo presentations give you an opportunity to showcase your software live for
the attendees. Demo sessions will be held alongside posters and you will be
provided with a table to place your laptop. There will be wifi connectivity
available but you need to bring your own laptop. Beyond that, it is entirely up
to you how you organize the demo.


# Option to publish in F1000 Galaxy gateway

Following GCC2024, you'll have an option to publish your slides or poster in the
[F1000 Galaxy gateway](https://f1000research.com/gateways/galaxy/). Besides
being a great collection of Galaxy-related content, each published artifact gets
a [DOI](https://www.doi.org/), making it easier to reference in the future.


# Abstract submission guidelines

We have several guidelines that will help you craft abstracts (and then
presentations) that will resonate with GCC2024 participants.

* **Limited to 500 words.** Please be concise and to the point. Abstract
  submission is a [web
  form](https://app.oxfordabstracts.com/stages/7067/submitter) so no graphics or
  references are to be included.
* **Relevance to Galaxy.** Does your work use, describe, extend, deploy,
  benchmark, etc., some part of the Galaxy ecosystem? If it does not, then it
  may not reviewed.
* **Compelling.** Is the work compelling? Will GCC2024 participants find your
  presentation interesting? Does the abstract describe novel work, interesting
  results, improvements, lessons learned, and so on.
* **Open Source / Open Access.** Not all presented work / resources must be open
  source / open access, but if it isn't, then you need a compelling reason why
  it isn't. For example, if you have implemented Galaxy in a company, behind a
  firewall, then your presentation should focus on the lessons you learned, and
  any contributions that were made back into the ecosystem. An abstract that
  merely highlights an inaccessible resource is not compelling.
* **You will need an Oxford Abstracts account.** We are using [Oxford
  Abstracts](https://oxfordabstracts.com/) portal for abstract submissions and
  they require a (free) account be created with them. Instructions on how to do
  so are [available on their
  website](https://help.oxfordabstracts.com/knowledge/creating-an-account-with-oxford-abstracts).

If you have any questions about the poster submission process, please reach out
to the [scientific committee
chair](/events/gcc2024/organizers/#scientific-program-chair).
