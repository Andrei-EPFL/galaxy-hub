**BRC Analytics Webinar**

This live Galaxy webinar will introduce new features of Galaxy, including several workflow improvements and new ways to save histories. Also, we will update on progress with BRC-Analytics, an NIAID-funded project to provide computing resources for research in public health and infectious disease.

Please join Anton Nekrutenko and the developer team for the first webinar with [BRC Analytics](https://brc-analytics.org). This will be a Q&A during which we will present the BRC Analytics roadmap, outlining how we hope to help the parasite and vector genomics communities.

- **Link:** https://psu.zoom.us/j/95358731919?pwd=3kKhOBgb3YCvYa3moycO6qgwlfy708.1
