# General information
Join us for a talk about the research data management. We are pleased to announce that Dr. Tilo Mathes, RSpace's Product Manager and Open Source Lead, will give an in-person talk at the University of Freiburg's Compute Center. The talk will be followed by a question and answer session.

This presentation examines the current state of research data management (RDM) and introduces RSpace and its journey towards an open-source front end for scientific research infrastructure. Despite significant developments over the past decade, RDM still faces critical challenges, with existing tools and infrastructure remaining disconnected and researchers viewing data management as an administrative burden. However, collaborative approaches to RDM have now received new impulses through emerging interoperability, research commons and research cloud models. Leveraging these models, RSpace has a unique opportunity to bridge gaps between researchers, data managers, tool providers, and research infrastructure by addressing technical and sociological interoperability challenges. With the transition into an open-source project RSpace is in a unique position to amplify efforts for streamlining data workflows by creating integrated research ecosystems and reduce barriers to (meta)data collection and curation.
