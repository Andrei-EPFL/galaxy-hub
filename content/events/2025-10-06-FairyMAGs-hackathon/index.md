# FairyMAGs Hackathon: Optimising Metagenomics Assembled Genomes building 🚀 

MAGs workflows are both **technically and scientifically challenging**, yet they are **essential tools** for reducing microbial dark matter, as most microbes cannot be cultivated.  

As part of the [FairyMAGs project](https://artifact.galaxyproject.org/news/2025-01-09-bfsp-fairy-ma-gs/) withhin the [ELIXIR BFSP Programme](https://elixir-europe.org/internal-projects/commissioned-services/science/biodiversity-security-pathogens), we are organizing a **4-day hackathon** and warmly invite the community to join us in Freiburg. This event is an opportunity to **collaborate, discuss, and improve MAGs workflows together!**  

# 🔬 What?
## A 4-day scientific and technical hackathon focused on:

### 🚀 Enhancing FAIR MAGs Workflows
* 🧩 Optimizing assembly strategies
  * Individual assembly vs. co-assembly vs. grouped-assembly
  * Automating decision-making for assembly selection
* 🔍 Bin refinement improvements
  * Where do we go beyond MetaWrap?
  * 🏗️ Should we integrate more binning tools for better results?

### 📚 Developing user-friendly training materials
* 🛠️ What parameters should users adjust?
* 🧑‍🏫 How to make complex concepts more accessible?

### 📊 Advancing evaluation methods (using CAMI infrastructure & real data)
* 🧬 Have metagenomic WGS samples? Want to create MAGs? This is your chance!

### ⚙️ Building intelligent resource estimation tools
* 🚦 Whether you're using Nextflow, Snakemake, or Galaxy, resource allocation is key
* ❌ Over-provisioning wastes resources; under-provisioning leads to failed jobs
* 🌍 Let’s design workflow-agnostic tools that optimize resource usage, reducing computational waste and environmental impact!

# 📍 Where?

# 📅 When?
October 06-09, 2025

This event is right after the [European Galaxy Days (EGD)](https://galaxyproject.org/events/2025-10-01-egd2025/), so you have the chance to 
make it a longer trip to Freiburg and profit from both events.
