The **European Galaxy Days** will be held from the **1st to 3rd of October 2025** in Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany. This 3-day meeting will be similar to the events we held in [2023](https://galaxyproject.org/events/2023-10-egd/),  [2022](https://galaxyproject.org/events/2022-10-egd/), [2018](https://galaxyproject.org/events/2018-europe-dev/), [2016](https://galaxyproject.org//events/sg2016/), [2014](https://galaxyproject.org//events/sg2014/), and [2012](https://galaxyproject.org//events/switzerland2012/). The first two days will give an overview of the current state of the Galaxy framework and community with several talks, demonstrations, and Birds of a Feather sessions. As part of a CoFest, the third day offer the opportunity to continue the discussions, to code and hack as well as enjoy the Galaxy community.

We are holding **3 events** in the same week:

- The **ELIXIR Galaxy Community Face-to-face (F2F)** meeting,
- The **EuroScienceGateway** project closure meeting,
- The **European Galaxy Days (EGD)** meeting.

We invite you to contribute and enrich our meeting through different activities such as talks, demos, posters, and Birds-of-a-feather meetings (BoFs). If you have something to share or talk about, we give you a slot in the schedule.
